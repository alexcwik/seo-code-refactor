1. One of the main portions of the refactoring was replacing some of the <div> elements with <class> elements. 

2. This reduced a lot of the clutter in the code. Some of the spacing was adjusted and indentations were added to the text in the <p> elements. 

3. Alt attributes were given to to the images for accessability purposes. 

4. A simple but identifable title was written in the code to help with seo.

5. Positonal adjustments using the margins were made in the css.

6. Many of my initial adjustments during the refactoring damaged the integerity of the original image so I had to re-adjust many of the elements repeatedly. 

7. Both the CSS and HTML file were edited through the SEO-CODE-REFACTOR folder in the main branch. The modifications were uploaded to the repository but there are still 
issues with the CSS loading. It works but for some reason not in GitHub.
